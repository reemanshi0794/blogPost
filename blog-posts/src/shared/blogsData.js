      "Alison Kent’s Dalton Gang trilogy is a different kind of western. Its members, Boone Mitchell, Dax Campbell, and Casper Jayne, aren’t the typical cowboys with hearts of gold. They may be elusive and sexy in that irresistible way, but they’re also rough, not easy to be around, and have legitimately dark pasts littered with secrets, abuse, and abandonment. It’s no surprise that when they all return to no-man’s-land Crow Hill, Texas, to inherit a ranch together that these men have more than tongues wagging as a result.",

      "The Science of Us takes a closer look at human behaviour and, in the process, teaches us how to become better freelancers (and people). From tricking yourself into feeling wide awake when you've had no sleep to dealing with anxiety. From understanding why you'll feel happier if you let yourself feel bad to de-stressing by talking about yourself in the third person – this is truly a fascinating and worthwhile read.",
